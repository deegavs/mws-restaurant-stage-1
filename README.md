## Project Description

This project is part of Udacity's Front End Web Development Nanodegree and the Mobile Web Specialist Certification Course. We were given a static webpage that's barely usable. It lacks the compatibility across different devices, doesn't have any standard accessibility feature and it cannot be used offline. Our task is to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality.

To achieve the lacking features on this **Restaurant Reviews** static webpage, we need to convert this webpage for a mobile-ready web application that is accessible for screen readers and has a service worker for offline use.

## TO DO

1. Implement media queries for responsiveness (project requirement).
2. Implement accessibility for screen readers (project requirement).
3. Create a Service Worker for offline use (project requirement).
4. Improve the layout and colour for a friendlier user experience (additional).

## Installation

1. You need to Download the Repository or Zip file and start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, explore the website to see what the current experience looks like with the implementation of responsive design, accessibility and offline use.

## Dependencies

* Python to run the website on my computer on a localhost           port(`http://localhost:8000`).
* Google maps `Javascript API` for the the live maps on this website.
* Most of the code in this project has been written to the `ES6 JavaScript` specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing `JavaScript code`.
